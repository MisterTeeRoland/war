# War
*Simple war card game using JavaScript*

A deck of cards is split between the player and the computer, face down.

Then the top card of each player's deck is flipped over and compared.
The player with the highest card wins both cards.

If the flipped cards are equal, then there is WAR. 
Up to four cards are drawn from each deck, and the fourth card is compared as normal.
The player with the highest card then wins all of the "war" cards.

The game ends when one player holds all of the cards.
